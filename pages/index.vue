      I assume that you came here to know me better. Well make yourself at home
      while I say a few words about myself.

      My name is Aliasghar Ghanati and I am a Software & Embedded Systems
      Engineer. Here are some pictures of me:

      I was born in Arak, an industrial, rather young city in Iran. One of the
      strongest memories of my childhood is the gracious walnut tree we had in
      our backyard, and I loved to just stand between its branchs and feel good.
      I feel sad every time I think about it, and the fact that this lovely tree
      was cut down to build an apartment on top of it. I hope to be able to
      reunite with this childhood friend in another world :) Another dear friend
      from my childhood is my dog, who I am still fortunate to keep company of.
      Here is a picture of him:

      Okay enough getting sentimental. I was talking about myself. I studied for
      8 years in Arak, before moving to Tehran (Capital of Iran) for High
      School. I finished my High School in this city after 4 years and went on
      to take the national university entrance exam. I ranked very good in this
      exam (top 0.1%) and was admitted to the best university in Iran, Sharif
      University of Technology. It took me 5 years to take my Bachelor's Degree
      in Computer Engineering from there, while making memorable moments.

      During the years of my undergraduate studies I aspired to become an
      independent man, and so decided to gather as much work experience as I
      can. I as a freelancer on many projects, and also worked with talented
      teams in a few companies. More details about my work experience and
      projects can be found in their respective tabs.

      Now let's get a little more technical. I was interested in computers since
      middle school, and even self-taught myself a little bit of Visual Basic
      with the help of some books back then. At the first year of high school we
      had a programming course and learned the basics of C++ and a little about
      graphics with this language, but sadly the prgoramming courses were
      omitted in the following years of high school and we did not get the
      chance to learn more. For my undergraduate studies I chose the field of
      Computer Engineering to relieve my thirst for knowledge about computers;
      and I am most satisfied with my choice back then. I learned to code with C
      and Java at the first and second semesters of university and went on teach
      myself python in the following summer. It was during this years that I
      learned the valuable skill of learning new things by myself. I learnt
      about Django in an event held by Students Scientific Chapter at my
      department, named Webelopers. I contributed to this very same event in the
      following 2 years by becoming a staff. After this I went to a spree of
      gaining new skills at every job or project I worked on, always looking to
      learn something new along with getting the job done.

      I kept this attitude in choosing my BSc thesis, choosing a field I was
      less experienced in to learn about it more as well as working on a project
      for my BSc degree. This led to an interest in the field of Embedded
      systems, and limitless ideas and possibilities I see in this field. At the
      moment, beside working at Akka finance as a software engineer, I pursue
      some personal projects in the field of embedded systems hoping to improve
      the lives of people around me.

      Now let's move on to my interests and hobbies. I have a profound love for
      stories of different kind, and I take significant joy in reading novels. I
      take a special interest in persian mythology and poems, and had been a
      member of central council of poetry and literature club at my university
      for 3 years, following these interests. I also love to play video games,
      mostly those with a remarkable narrative. And last but not least, I enjoy
      having physical exercise, and feel good after a good session of exercise.
      My favorite field in sports is archery, and I have been practicing it for
      a few years now.
